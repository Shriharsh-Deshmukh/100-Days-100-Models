## 📂 File Naming Convention

Each project file follows the format:  
**`(Pr-X)Dataset_Model.ipynb`**

- **`Pr-X`**: Project number (e.g., `Pr-1` for Project 1).  
- **`Dataset`**: Dataset used (e.g., `Delaney` for `Delaney_solubility_with_descriptors.csv`).  
- **`Model`**: Models trained, abbreviated (e.g., `Lr&Rf` for Linear Regression and Random Forest).  

**Example**:  
`(Pr-1)Delaney_Lr&Rf.ipynb`  
- Project: 1  
- Dataset: `Delaney_solubility_with_descriptors.csv`  
- Models: Linear Regression (`Lr`) and Random Forest (`Rf`).
